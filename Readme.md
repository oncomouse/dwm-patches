# oncomouse's DWM Patches

Here is my repository for patches to [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org), the tiling window manager for X11.

## Contents

* **Centered Monocle** -- This patch adds the `centeredmonocle` mode to DWM, which is just like `monocle` mode but the single master window is centered on the screen, using the variable `cm_scale` to control how much space is available.
	* Available in both plain and with [vanitygaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patcheds/vanitygaps) support added.
